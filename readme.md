# Gower Distance Calculation for MATLAB
=====================================

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the Gower distance calculation for datasets.

## Overview
------------

The Gower distance is a measure of similarity between two data points that can handle mixed data types (numeric and categorical). This repository provides a MATLAB function to calculate the Gower distance between data points in a dataset.

## Usage
---------

To use the Gower distance calculation function, simply clone this repository and run the `gower_distance` function in MATLAB.
